Chocobo Hot and Cold QOL
Version 1.0
Author: CheddarBung

================================
BRIEF OVERVIEW
================================

A modular QoL rework of FF9’s Chocobo Hot & Cold, centered around Chocobo Naturalist — 
a Turbo-off, vanilla-feel experience that preserves tension and pacing without the 
brutal time sink. Also includes Boosted and Guaranteed Chance modes, plus a pure 
vanilla option.

================================
DESCRIPTION
================================

Chocobo Hot and Cold QOL provides quality-of-life improvements to Final Fantasy IX’s
Chocobo Hot & Cold minigame while respecting vanilla progression, story flow, and
overall balance.

The mod offers multiple selectable modes that adjust RNG behavior to suit different
playstyles — from the untouched classic experience to streamlined options for players
who want faster or more reliable access to chocographs.

No dialogue, story, or world progression logic has been modified.

================================
AVAILABLE MODES
================================

Chocographer (Guaranteed Chance)
--------------------------------
100% chocograph and chocograph piece chance, if available.
Ideal for players who simply want to reach Ozma and obtain loot without fighting RNG.
This mode removes randomness entirely from the minigame.

Lucky Beak (Boosted)
--------------------
Designed for players who still enjoy Turbo mode but want fewer dry runs.
Slightly improved chocograph and piece chance.
More than one chocograph or piece can be found per round.

Chocobo Naturalist (Recommended)
--------------------------------
Designed for players who want the natural feel of the game without the time sink it
demands.
Intended for Turbo-off play: beak level matters, routing matters, and the clock
matters.
Greatly improved chocograph and piece chance while preserving the tension and pacing
of the original minigame.
More than one chocograph or piece can be found per round.

Vanilla
-------
The classic Hot & Cold experience with completely unmodified vanilla behavior.
Included for convenience and easy switching without uninstalling the mod.

COMPATIBILITY & LOAD ORDER
================================

- Compatible with Memoria
- Compatible with Moguri Mod
- Compatible with Alternate Fantasy

================================
KNOWN EDGE CASES & NOTES
================================

- As with any RNG-adjusting mod, extremely unlikely edge cases may still exist.
- One such case is reaching the maximum number of digs in a session without finding
  a chocograph or piece. While unlikely in most modes, the game should still exit the
  minigame cleanly.
- No widespread freezes or softlocks have been observed during testing.

This mod does not introduce invasive hooks or persistent state changes, minimizing
the risk of save corruption or long-term instability.

================================
SAVE COMPATIBILITY
================================

- Safe to use on existing saves
- Modes can be switched mid-playthrough
- No permanent flags or progression data are altered

================================
DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (SHORT)
================================

The goal of this mod is not to remove challenge, but to reduce unnecessary frustration
and respect the player’s time.

Chocobo Naturalist represents the intended experience of this mod: the original feel
of Chocobo Hot & Cold, refined rather than replaced.
