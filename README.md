# Chocobo Hot and Cold QOL

Quality-of-life tweaks for **Final Fantasy IX’s Chocobo Hot and Cold** that respect vanilla progression.

This mod offers multiple modes that adjust RNG behavior to suit different playstyles, ranging from the untouched classic experience to highly streamlined options for players who want faster access to chocographs.

Compatible with **Alternate Fantasy** and **Ferny Fantasy**.  
Place **above them** in the mod load order.

## Modes

### Chocographer
**100% chocograph and chocograph piece chance**, if available.

For players who simply want to reach **Ozma** and get loot without fighting RNG at all.

---

### Lucky Beak

Lucky Beak is for players who just want to **speed up the vanilla Turbo experience** without turning Hot & Cold into a cheat.

It’s tuned to average **about 2½ chocographs over a full eight-dig round**, with slightly improved odds and the ability to find **more than one chocograph or piece per session**. RNG is still part of the process, and you’ll still find items — everything just moves along faster.

The goal was simple: keep Turbo on, play fewer rounds, make steady progress, and be done **without fully removing the randomness**.

### Chocobo Naturalist (Recommended)

I made Chocobo Naturalist because I wanted to play Hot & Cold **in real time, without Turbo**, and still feel like a few normal sessions were enough to make real progress.

It’s tuned so you can find **more than one chocograph per round**, averaging **about 2½ chocographs within the first six digs**, with rewards scaling up fast if you push into higher dig counts.

The goal was simple: let you play a handful of focused sessions, have a good time, and be done — **without Turbo and without feeling like you’re cheating**.

---

### Vanilla

Vanilla preserves the **classic Hot & Cold experience**, completely untouched.

Useful as a dedicated Hot & Cold override if you want to keep **vanilla Hot & Cold behavior** while using other mods that edit  
**Barrel_38, Barrel_41, and Barrel_46**.
